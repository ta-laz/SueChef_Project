## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

- Install the .NET Entity Framework CLI
  * `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
- Create the database/s in `psql`
  * `CREATE DATABASE suechef_development;`
  * `CREATE DATABASE suechef_test;`
- Run the migration to create the tables
  * `cd` into `/SueChef`
  * `dotnet ef database update`
  * `DATABASE_NAME=suechef_development dotnet ef database update`
- Start the application, with the development database
  * `DATABASE_NAME=suechef_development dotnet watch run`
- Go to `http://localhost:5287/`

## Running the Tests

- Install playwright package
  * `dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright`
- Install playwright browser
  * `pwsh bin/Debug/net9.0/playwright.ps1 install`
- Verify its installation
 * `dotnet list package`
- Start the application, with the default (test) database
  * `dotnet watch run`
- Open a second terminal session and run the tests
  * `dotnet test`

### Troubleshooting

If you see a popup about not being able to open Chromedriver...
- Go to **System Preferences > Security and Privacy > General**
- There should be another message about Chromedriver there
- If so, Click on **Allow Anyway**

## Updating the Database

Changes are applied to the database programatically, using files called _migrations_, which live in the `/Migrations` directory. The process is as follows...

- To update an existing table
  * For example, you might want to add a title to the `Post` model
  * In which case, you would add a new field there
- To create a new table
  * For example, you might want to add a table called Comments
  * First, create the `Comment` model
  * Then go to Project3DbContext
  * And add this `public DbSet<Comment>? Comments { get; set; }` 
- Generate the migration file
  * `cd` into `/Project3`
  * Decide what you wan to call the migration file
  * `AddTitleToPosts` or `CreateCommentsTable` would be good descriptive names
  * Then do `dotnet ef migrations add ` followed by the name you chose
  * E.g.  `dotnet ef migrations add AddTitleToPosts`
- Run the migration
  * `dotnet ef database update`

### Troubleshooting

#### Seeing `role "postgres" does not exist`?

Your application tries to connect to the database as a user called `postgres`, which is normally created automatically when you install PostgresQL. If the `postgres` user doesn't exist, you'll see `role "postgres" does not exist`.

To fix it, you'll need to create the `postgres` user.

Try this in your terminal...

```
; createuser -s postgres
```

If you see `command not found: createuser`, start a new `psql` session and do this...

```sql
create user postgres;
```

#### Want to Change an Existing Migration?

Don't edit the migration files after they've been applied / run. If you do that, it'll probably lead to problems. If you decide that the migration you just applied wasn't quite right for some reason, you have two options

- Create and run another migration (using the process above)

OR...

- Rollback / undo the last migration
- Then edit the migration file before re-running it

How do you rollbacl a migration? Let's assume that you have two migrations, both of which have been applied.

1. CreatePostsAndUsers
2. AddTitleToPosts

To rollback the second, you again use `dotnet ef database update` but this time adding the name of the last 'good' migration. In this case, that would be `CreatePostsAndUsers`. So the command is...

```shell
; dotnet ef database update CreatePostsAndUsers
```

---

## üìò Project Overview

SueChef is a dynamic full-stack web application that allows users to browse and comment on recipes, rate dishes, create meal plans, and automatically generate shopping lists.  
It expands on the functionality of traditional recipe sites like BBC Good Food by integrating **nutrition tracking**, **serving-size scaling**, and **personalised meal planning** tools.  

This project was developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **PostgreSQL**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and supported by **modular JavaScript** for interactivity.  
SueChef offers a responsive, accessible experience and a modern MVC-based architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Razor Views (Tailwind CSS)**
- **JavaScript (modular scripts)**
- **xUnit (Testing)**
- **DotNetEnv (Environment Management)**
- **Google OAuth + Session Authentication**

## üìÅ Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/Controllers` | Request handling and route logic |
| `/Models` | Database entities and EF Core schemas |
| `/Views` | Razor pages and UI rendering |

## üß© Architecture & Design

### 2.1 Overview

SueChef follows the **Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC)** pattern using ASP.NET Core.  
This promotes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Model:** Defines application data and EF Core relationships.  
- **View:** Razor templates that dynamically render HTML and Tailwind styling.  
- **Controller:** Handles routes, processes requests, and connects models to views.

### 2.2 Request Flow

```
[Browser] ‚Üí [Controller] ‚Üí [Model/DbContext] ‚Üí [Controller] ‚Üí [View] ‚Üí [Browser]
```

### 2.3 Application Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Example Files |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Model** | Defines schema, validation, and logic | `UserModel.cs`, `RecipeModel.cs`, `MealPlanModel.cs` |
| **View** | Renders Razor pages with Tailwind UI | `_Layout.cshtml`, `RecipeDetails/Index.cshtml` |
| **Controller** | Routes and handles logic | `MealPlanController.cs`, `RecipeDetailsController.cs` |
| **Database Context** | EF Core ORM bridge | `SueChefDbContext.cs` |

### 2.4 Design Principles

- **Entity Framework Core** for ORM and migrations  
- **Tailwind CSS** for clean, responsive UI  
- **Session-based authentication** for simplicity and security  
- **Custom Action Filter** for route protection (`AuthenticationFilter.cs`)  
- **Reusable ViewModels** for componentised front-end rendering  

---

## üçΩÔ∏è Database Design

### 3.1 Overview

SueChef uses **Entity Framework Core** with PostgreSQL to manage its relational schema.  
The schema captures relationships between users, recipes, ingredients, comments, and meal plans.

### 3.2 Entity Summary

| Entity | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **User** | Stores user credentials and links to recipes, comments, and ratings |
| **Chef** | Represents authors of recipes |
| **Recipe** | Core entity containing cooking instructions, nutritional data, and relationships |
| **Ingredient** | Tracks macro values and measurement units |
| **RecipeIngredient** | Join table linking recipes and ingredients |
| **Comment** | Stores user comments on recipes |
| **Rating** | Represents a user‚Äôs rating for a recipe |
| **MealPlan** | User-created collection of recipes with soft-delete functionality |
| **MealPlanRecipe** | Links recipes to meal plans |

### 3.3 Relationships

| Relationship | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| User ‚Üí Recipe | One-to-Many | A user can create multiple recipes |
| User ‚Üí Comment | One-to-Many | A user can write multiple comments |
| User ‚Üí Rating | One-to-Many | A user can rate multiple recipes |
| Recipe ‚Üí Ingredient | Many-to-Many | Recipes include many ingredients |
| Recipe ‚Üí Comment | One-to-Many | A recipe can have multiple comments |
| Recipe ‚Üí Rating | One-to-Many | A recipe can have multiple ratings |
| MealPlan ‚Üí Recipe | Many-to-Many | A meal plan contains multiple recipes |

## üéÆ Controllers

### 4.1 Overview

SueChef‚Äôs controllers act as the bridge between frontend requests and backend logic.  
They manage recipe browsing, meal plan creation, authentication, and commenting.

### 4.2 Controller Summary

| Controller | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **HomeController** | Renders homepage and category carousels. |
| **RecipeDetailsController** | Displays recipe details, comments, and ratings. |
| **CategoriesController** | Filters recipes by difficulty, dietary type, or popularity. |
