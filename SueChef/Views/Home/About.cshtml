                The heart, soul, and occasionally singed apron behind <strong>SueChef</strong>.
                Granny Sue’s kitchen is where chaos and comfort meet — a place where measurements are more like
                suggestions, recipes turn into adventures, and love is always the main ingredient.

            <h3 class="text-2xl text-rose-800 font-semibold">Her Story</h3>
            <p>
                Sue was born in a tiny coastal town where ovens were unreliable, ingredients were improvised, and
                laughter was mandatory. From the start, she had a knack for turning “whoops” into “wow.”
                Legend has it her first cake collapsed in the middle — so she filled it with custard and called it
                “intentional.” Thus began a lifelong journey of culinary improvisation and joyful rebellion against
                perfection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, Granny Sue became famous in her community for her hearty stews, slightly suspicious
                experimental bakes, and a catchphrase whispered through generations:
                <span class="italic text-rose-700">“If it tastes good, it’s done!”</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                When the digital age arrived, Sue’s grandchildren convinced her to share her recipes online — but she
                misunderstood the assignment. Instead of recipes, she uploaded stories: tales of spilled flour, burnt
                pans, and unfiltered joy.
                Those stories became the seed that grew into <strong>SueChef</strong> — a celebration of food,
                community,
                and perfectly imperfect cooking.
